00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.880
Hello. I just wanted to share kind of my
process when I'm doing some maintenance on

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.600
my new tank. Um, right here you can see
me just clearing out some little leaves

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.360
that had fallen off the other plants that
were in there. I'm putting the I have an

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.120
anubius there that I'm putting back into the
rocks because the fish kind of pushed it out.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.480
Um, I'm just putting the hose on right now.
And I like to clip it into the bucket so that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.600
um, the hose stays while I'm draining the tank.
So, right here, I'm just draining the tank. And

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.200
if I see anything floating, I'm just putting
it into the end of the tank or the tube so that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.320
it'll go into the bucket. So, this takes a takes
a minute. This is four times speed. So, it's takes

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.200
a lot longer than it looks like um, here, but the
fish are always interested. You can see the little

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.520
ember tetras checking out the tube and wondering
what's happening to their home right now.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.400
Um, so there we go. I got it emptied. Now
I'm going to put the bucket up on top so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.680
I can clean out the sponge filter that I have
in there. So you just pull it out and squeeze

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.920
it into the bucket. And the reason you just
do it in the the tank water is so that you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.520
don't lose any of that beneficial bacteria. Um,
and now you can see me here. I I have a little

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.680
hose attachment to my bathroom, so I can just
fill up the tank straight from the faucet. Um,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.720
there can be risks with doing that just cuz
there's chlorine in the water, but I have

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.040
some dechlorinator that I'll put in later and
also Utah's water is not super chlorinated,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.360
so it's not quite as dangerous for the
fish. Um, so here I am just filling it up.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.240
And I'm shooting it into the side of the tank so
it doesn't disturb the fish as much and doesn't

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.520
move any of the plants too much. Um, so now
it's full. Now I'm going to grab all of the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.600
additives that I put in the water just to help
with plant growth and to dechlorinate the water.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.360
So right there I have some CO2 booster which helps
plants, some leaf zone which is like a fertilizer.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.760
um acute clear here that helps to clump all of
the particles in the water so that the filter

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.120
can pick it up. And here it is afterwards. The
water clears up a little bit more over time. Um,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.520
and I usually like to feed them afterward, just
to make sure they're doing okay, and they'll come

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.920
up and you can see them swimming around here.
But that's my tank maintenance for my new tank.
